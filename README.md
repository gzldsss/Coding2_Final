I made a piano that can play rhythm happily!
## 

This is a code for openFrameworks that loads and plays sounds, displays an image, and shows information about the playing sounds. The sounds are loaded in the **setup()** function using ofSoundPlayer, and their volumes are set. The **update()** function is used to update the sound playing system. The **draw()** function displays the image and shows text information about the sounds on the bottom of the screen.

The screen is divided into seven parts, and each part is used to display information about a specific sound. The text includes the sound name, progress, speed, and instructions on how to play the sound. When a sound is playing, its text turns red.

The sounds are: background music, rain, cymbal, finger snap, punch, piano, and bass. The **setMultiPlay()** function is used to prevent the sounds from playing simultaneously.

The process of doing this homework is pleasant, because I like music very much, and I hope that I can make some music by myself in the future, and I can make interesting codes that can edit music. This homework gave me a deeper understanding of openframeworks, and I will continue to learn.
